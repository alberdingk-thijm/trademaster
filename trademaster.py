""" TRADEMASTER PROGRAM
This program helps organize and maintain a list of commodities
in a given D&D market at specific prices based on distances,
manufacturing costs and scarcity.

There are 3 basic systems working together:
    - a parser, which reads in CSV files and initializes a world area
    - a computer, which determines the costs to produce goods in a given
    locale using Dijkstra's algorithm
    - a viewer, which reports the results as a set of CSV files representing
    available goods
